# Awesome Ancent Egypt

_Last updated: 2024.10.26._

A curated list of online resources about [Ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt).

Content is limited to free-to-access, English language material targeting mainly non-academic, adult audience. There is a huge amount of online resources available, so the selection here is somewhat subjective to keep the length limited.
